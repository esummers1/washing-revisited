# Washing Revisited

## Background

I learned to program when I was 10 or 11 in primary school, on BBC Microcomputers running BBC BASIC (these were old at the time - this was in the early 2000s).

One of the first programs we were introduced to on machines like these was an educational text adventure/puzzle game called [L](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L_%E2%80%93_A_Mathemagical_Adventure). The first program I remember writing myself was a game in the same style that I called Washing, in which the player is shrunk by a wizard and has to escape a washing basket full of dangerous garments.

I thought it would be fun to revisit this concept in a modern programming language, since in those days the game was a single procedure with dozens of `GOTO` calls.

Since I unfortunately no longer have the original source code - the 5.25" floppy disk that held it may exist somewhere - I have had to reconstruct it from memory, but the spirit is the same.

## Setup

Results will be best in a terminal window 80 columns wide.

- Install at least JDK 1.8
- Run the following from the project root:

```bash
./gradlew run
```
